Hate Speech Detection

##Overview

This project focuses on detecting hate speech in text data using machine learning techniques. The aim is to classify whether a given text contains hate speech, offensive language, or neither. The model can help in monitoring social media, comments, and online platforms for harmful content.

##Dataset

The dataset used for this project is synthetic data that contains the following columns:

- count: Numeric count of something related to the tweet.
- hatespeech: Integer (0-100) representing the percentage of hate speech in the tweet.
- offensive_language: Integer (0-100) representing the percentage of offensive language in the tweet.
- neither: Integer (0-100) representing the percentage of neither hate speech nor offensive language.
- class: Target variable (0 = Hate Speech, 1 = Offensive Language, 2 = Neither).
- tweet: Text of the tweet.

The dataset consists of 25,000 rows and is preprocessed to remove duplicates and irrelevant characters.

## Models

Several machine learning models were used for classification, including:

- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression  

These models were trained using the dataset mentioned above, and their performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hate-speech-detection.git
   cd hate-speech-detection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before training the model, you need to preprocess the data. Use the following command to run the preprocessing script:

   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning models by running the model training script:

   ```bash
   python src/model.py
   ```

3. **Prediction**: To classify new data, use the trained model to make predictions:

   ```bash
   python src/predict.py --input "path_to_input_data"
   ```

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%**. Detailed results of the model's performance can be found in the [Results](results.md) file.

Metrics used for evaluation include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
